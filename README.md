# UofT-OGS-Application-Download-Tool
Allows administrators to batch download Ontario Graduate Scholarship applications and rename as Student Name.

TIP SHEET

-do not click the "minimize" button on the browser that is downloading the apps. It is fine to open and work on other applications on top of the browser.
-use the "OGS_MasterSpreadsheet.xlsx" template in the folder. The script searches the OGS applications site for the name from the "referee.1.studentName" column.
-when entering the downloads folder, make sure this is the full directory (e.g. C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads\)
